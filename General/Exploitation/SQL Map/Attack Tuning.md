## Prefix/Suffix
```bash
sqlmap -u "www.example.com/?q=test" --prefix="%'))" --suffix="-- -"
```

## Level/Risk
For such demands, the options `--level` and `--risk` should be used:

- The option `--level` (`1-5`, default `1`) extends both vectors and boundaries being used, based on their expectancy of success (i.e., the lower the expectancy, the higher the level).
    
- The option `--risk` (`1-3`, default `1`) extends the used vector set based on their risk of causing problems at the target side (i.e., risk of database entry loss or denial-of-service).

```shell-session
$ sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 -v 3 --level=5
```
```shell-session
$ sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 -v 3
```
```shell-session
$ sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1
```
```shell-session
$ sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --level=5 --risk=3
```

### Advanced Tuning

SQLMap offers various advanced options to fine-tune detection. While typically not needed, these settings can be useful in specific cases.

#### Status Codes
When dealing with dynamic content, the difference between TRUE and FALSE responses may be visible in HTTP status codes (e.g., `200` for TRUE and `500` for FALSE). The option `--code` can be used to focus on a specific status code.

#### Titles
If the difference between responses is identifiable through HTTP page titles, the `--titles` option allows SQLMap to compare based on the content of the `<title>` tag.

#### Strings
If a specific string (e.g., "success") appears in TRUE responses but not in FALSE ones, the `--string` option can be used to detect based on that string.

#### Text-only
When dealing with hidden content like HTML tags (`<script>`, `<style>`, `<meta>`), the `--text-only` switch can strip out all tags and focus only on visible content.

#### Techniques
To restrict SQLMap to specific SQL injection techniques, the `--technique` option allows you to specify the desired types (e.g., boolean-based, error-based, UNION-query) while excluding others like time-based blind.

#### UNION SQLi Tuning
For UNION SQL injections, if the number of columns in the vulnerable query is known, you can use the `--union-cols` option to specify the exact number. If the default SQLMap values (e.g., `NULL`, random integers) aren't suitable, you can provide alternative values with `--union-char`. Additionally, if the query requires a `FROM <table>` clause (as with Oracle), you can set that with `--union-from`.
