## Password Policy

The personalized password wordlist we generated is about 43,000 lines long. Since we saw the password policy when we logged in, we know that the password must meet the following conditions:

1. 8 characters or longer
2. contains special characters
3. contains numbers

So, we can remove any passwords that do not meet these conditions from our wordlist. Some tools would convert password policies to `Hashcat` or `John` rules, but `hydra` does not support rules for filtering passwords. So, we will simply use the following commands to do that for us:
```bash
sed -ri '/^.{,7}$/d' william.txt            # remove shorter than 8
sed -ri '/[!-/:-@\[-`\{-~]+/!d' william.txt # remove no special chars
sed -ri '/[0-9]+/!d' william.txt            # remove no numbers
```

OTHER:
- Minimum Length: 6 characters
- Must Include:
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one lowercase letter
    - At least one number
    - At least two special characters (from the set `!@#$%^&*`)
```shell-session
$ grep -E '^.{6,}$' jane.txt | grep -E '[A-Z]' | grep -E '[a-z]' | grep -E '[0-9]' | grep -E '([!@#$%^&*].*){2,}' > jane-filtered.txt
```
## Mangling

It is still possible to create many permutations of each word in that list. We never know how our target thinks when creating their password, and so our safest option is to add as many alterations and permutations as possible, noting that this will, of course, take much more time to brute force.

Many great tools do word mangling and case permutation quickly and easily, like [rsmangler](https://github.com/digininja/RSMangler) or [The Mentalist](https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist.git). These tools have many other options, which can make any small wordlist reach millions of lines long. We should keep these tools in mind because we might need them in other modules and situations.

As a starting point, we will stick to the wordlist we have generated so far and not perform any mangling on it. In case our wordlist does not hit a successful login, we will go back to these tools and perform some mangling to increase our chances of guessing the password.
