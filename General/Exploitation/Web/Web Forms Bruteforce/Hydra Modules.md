## Brute Forcing Forms
```shell-session
$ hydra -h | grep "Supported services" | tr ":" "\n" | tr " " "\n" | column -e
```
In this situation there are only two types of `http` modules interesting for us:

1. `http[s]-{head|get|post}`
2. `http[s]-post-form`

The 1st module serves for basic HTTP authentication, while the 2nd module is used for login forms, like `.php` or `.aspx` and others.
Since the file extension is "`.php`" we should try the `http[s]-post-form` module. To decide which module we need, we have to determine whether the web application uses `GET` or a `POST` form. We can test it by trying to log in and pay attention to the URL. If we recognize that any of our input was pasted into the `URL`, the web application uses a `GET` form. Otherwise, it uses a `POST` form.
When we try to log in with any credentials and don't see any of our input in the URL, and the URL does not change, we know that the web application uses a `POST` form.
Based on the URL scheme at the beginning, we can determine whether this is an `HTTP` or `HTTPS` post-form. If our target URL shows `http`, in this case, we should use the `http-post-form` module.

To find out how to use the `http-post-form` module, we can use the "`-U`" flag to list the parameters it requires and examples of usage:

## Fail/Success String
|**Type**|**Boolean Value**|**Flag**|
|---|---|---|
|`Fail`|FALSE|`F=html_content`|
|`Success`|TRUE|`S=html_content`|
