We can easily find POST parameters if we intercept the login request with Burp Suite or take a closer look at the admin panel's source code.
One of the easiest ways to capture a form's parameters is through using a browser's built in developer tools. For example, we can open firefox within PwnBox, and then bring up the Network Tools with `[CTRL + SHIFT + E]`.

Once we do, we can simply try to login with any credentials (`test`:`test`) to run the form, after which the Network Tools would show the sent HTTP requests. Once we have the request, we can simply right-click on one of them, and select `Copy` > `Copy POST data`:

#### Copy cURL command:
```shell-session
$ curl 'http://178.128.40.63:31554/login.php' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Origin: http://178.128.40.63:31554' -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Referer: http://178.128.40.63:31554/login.php' -H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=8iafr4t6c3s2nhkaj63df43v05' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H 'Sec-GPC: 1' --data-raw 'username=test&password=test'
