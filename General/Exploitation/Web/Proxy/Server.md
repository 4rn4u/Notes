In Burp, we can enable response interception by going to (`Proxy>Options`) and enabling `Intercept Response` under `Intercept Server Responses`:

Once we forward the request, we'll see our intercepted response:![Burp Intercept Response](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/response_intercept_response_1_1.jpg)

Let's try to see how we can do the same with ZAP. As we saw in the previous section, when our requests are intercepted by ZAP, we can click on `Step`, and it will send the request and automatically intercept the response:
