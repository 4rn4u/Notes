## Proxychains

One very useful tool in Linux is [proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains), which routes all traffic coming from any command-line tool to any proxy we specify. `Proxychains` adds a proxy to any command-line tool and is hence the simplest and easiest method to route web traffic of command-line tools through our web proxies.

To use `proxychains`, we first have to edit `/etc/proxychains.conf`, comment out the final line and add the following line at the end of it:
We should also enable `Quiet Mode` to reduce noise by un-commenting `quiet_mode`. Once that's done, we can prepend `proxychains` to any command, and the traffic of that command should be routed through `proxychains` (i.e., our web proxy). For example, let's try using `cURL` on one of our previous exercises:

## Nmap
```shell-session
$ nmap --proxies http://127.0.0.1:8080 SERVER_IP -pPORT -Pn -sC
```

## Metasploit
```shell-session
$ msfconsole

msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/robots_txt
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set PROXIES HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080

PROXIES => HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080


msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set RHOST SERVER_IP

RHOST => SERVER_IP


msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set RPORT PORT

RPORT => PORT


msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > run

[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
