**Note:** We may also modify the `Content-Type` of the uploaded file, though this should not play an important role at this stage, so we'll keep it unmodified.

## Disabling Front-end Validation
To start, we can click [`CTRL+SHIFT+C`] to toggle the browser's `Page Inspector`, and then click on the profile image, which is where we trigger the file selector for the upload form:

```html
<input type="file" name="uploadFile" id="uploadFile" onchange="checkFile(this)" accept=".jpg,.jpeg,.png">
```
The more interesting part is `onchange="checkFile(this)"`, which appears to run a JavaScript code whenever we select a file, which appears to be doing the file type validation. To get the details of this function, we can go to the browser's `Console` by clicking [`CTRL+SHIFT+K`], and then we can type the function's name (`checkFile`) to get its details:
```javascript
function checkFile(File) {
...SNIP...
    if (extension !== 'jpg' && extension !== 'jpeg' && extension !== 'png') {
        $('#error_message').text("Only images are allowed!");
        File.form.reset();
        $("#submit").attr("disabled", true);
    ...SNIP...
    }
}
```
