## Automated Discovery
```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike.git
$ cd XSStrike
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python xsstrike.py
```

```shell-session
$ python xsstrike.py -u "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php?task=test" 
```
Try to verify the above payload by testing it on one of the previous exercises. You may also try testing out the other tools and run them on the same exercises to see how capable they are in detecting XSS vulnerabilities.

## Manual Discovery
#### XSS Payloads

The most basic method of looking for XSS vulnerabilities is manually testing various XSS payloads against an input field in a given web page. We can find huge lists of XSS payloads online, like the one on [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md) or the one in [PayloadBox](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list). We can then begin testing these payloads one by one by copying each one and adding it in our form, and seeing whether an alert box pops up.
