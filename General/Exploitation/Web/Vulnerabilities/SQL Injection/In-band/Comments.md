Just like any other language, SQL allows the use of comments as well. Comments are used to document queries or ignore a certain part of the query. We can use two types of line comments with MySQL `--` and `#`, in addition to an in-line comment `/**/` (though this is not usually used in SQL injections). The `--` can be used as follows:

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT username FROM logins; -- Selects usernames from the logins table 
```
```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username = 'admin'; # You can place anything here AND password = 'something'
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin'-- ' AND password = 'something';
```

The login failed due to a syntax error, as a closed one did not balance the open parenthesis. To execute the query successfully, we will have to add a closing parenthesis. Let us try using the username `admin')--` to close and comment out the rest.
