### Active Reconnaissance Techniques Overview

Active reconnaissance involves direct interaction with the target system to gather valuable information. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at various techniques, their descriptions, examples, tools, and associated risks of detection:

#### Port Scanning

- **Description**: Identifying open ports and services running on the target.
- **Example**: Using Nmap to scan a web server for open ports like 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
- **Tools**: Nmap, Masscan, Unicornscan
- **Risk of Detection**: **High** - Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls.

#### Vulnerability Scanning

- **Description**: Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfigurations.
- **Example**: Running Nessus against a web application to check for SQL injection flaws or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Tools**: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto
- **Risk of Detection**: **High** - Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect.

#### Network Mapping

- **Description**: Mapping the target's network topology, including connected devices and their relationships.
- **Example**: Using traceroute to determine the path packets take to reach the target server, revealing potential network hops and infrastructure.
- **Tools**: Traceroute, Nmap
- **Risk of Detection**: **Medium to High** - Excessive or unusual network traffic can raise suspicion.

#### Banner Grabbing

- **Description**: Retrieving information from banners displayed by services running on the target.
- **Example**: Connecting to a web server on port 80 and examining the HTTP banner to identify the web server software and version.
- **Tools**: Netcat, curl
- **Risk of Detection**: **Low** - Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged.

#### OS Fingerprinting

- **Description**: Identifying the operating system running on the target.
- **Example**: Using Nmap's OS detection capabilities (`-O`) to determine if the target is running Windows, Linux, or another OS.
- **Tools**: Nmap, Xprobe2
- **Risk of Detection**: **Low** - OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected.

#### Service Enumeration

- **Description**: Determining the specific versions of services running on open ports.
- **Example**: Using Nmap's service version detection (`-sV`) to determine if a web server is running Apache 2.4.50 or Nginx 1.18.0.
- **Tools**: Nmap
- **Risk of Detection**: **Low** - Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts.

#### Web Spidering

- **Description**: Crawling the target website to identify web pages, directories, and files.
- **Example**: Running a web crawler like Burp Suite Spider or OWASP ZAP Spider to map out the structure of a website and discover hidden resources.
- **Tools**: Burp Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider, Scrapy (customizable)
- **Risk of Detection**: **Low to Medium** - Can be detected if the crawler's behavior is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic.
