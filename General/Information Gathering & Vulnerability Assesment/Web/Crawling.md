# Crawling Overview

Crawling, or spidering, is the automated process of systematically browsing the web to discover and index web pages. Web crawlers, using pre-defined algorithms, follow links from one page to another, collecting information for purposes like search engine indexing, data analysis, or web reconnaissance.

## How Web Crawlers Work

Crawlers start with a seed URL, fetch the page, and extract its links. These links are added to a queue and crawled iteratively, allowing the crawler to explore an entire website or even a large portion of the web.

### Example Crawl

1. **Homepage**: Contains links to `link1`, `link2`, and `link3`.
2. **Visiting `link1`**: Reveals more links (`link4`, `link5`), and so on.
3. **Continuing the Crawl**: The crawler systematically follows these links, gathering accessible pages and their links.

## Crawling Strategies

- **Breadth-First Crawling**: Explores all links on the seed page first, then moves to the links on those pages. Useful for getting an overview of a website's structure.
- **Depth-First Crawling**: Follows a single path of links as far as possible before backtracking. Useful for finding specific or deep content within a website.

## Extracting Valuable Information

Crawlers can gather various data, crucial for reconnaissance:

- **Links (Internal and External)**: Map out a website's structure and discover hidden pages.
- **Comments**: May contain sensitive information inadvertently revealed by users.
- **Metadata**: Provides context like page titles, descriptions, and keywords.
- **Sensitive Files**: Crawlers can search for exposed files like backups, configuration files, and logs.

## Importance of Context

The value of the extracted data lies in its context. For example, a comment mentioning software version combined with outdated metadata or a vulnerable configuration file can reveal a critical vulnerability. By analyzing data holistically, you can uncover hidden patterns and significant findings that might be overlooked if considered in isolation.
