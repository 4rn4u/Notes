Once we have a basic understanding of the company and its services, we can get an initial impression of its online presence. Suppose a medium-sized company has hired us to test their entire infrastructure from a black-box perspective. This means we have only received a scope of targets and must gather all further information on our own.

The first point of presence on the Internet might be the SSL certificate from the company's main website. Often, such a certificate includes more than just a subdomain, indicating that it is used for several domains that are likely still active.

Another source to find more subdomains is crt.sh, which utilizes Certificate Transparency logs. Certificate Transparency is a process designed to verify issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections. The standard (RFC 6962) mandates that all digital certificates issued by a certificate authority be logged in audit-proof logs. This helps detect false or maliciously issued certificates for a domain. SSL certificate providers, like Let's Encrypt, share this information with the crt.sh web interface, which stores new entries in a database for later access.
