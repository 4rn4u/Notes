# Network File System (NFS)

Network File System (NFS) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems, designed to access file systems over a network as if they were local, similar to SMB. However, NFS uses a completely different protocol and is primarily used between Linux and Unix systems, meaning NFS clients cannot directly communicate with SMB servers.

NFS is an Internet standard that dictates procedures in a distributed file system. NFS protocol version 3.0 (NFSv3), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer. This changes with NFSv4, where user authentication is required, similar to the Windows SMB protocol.
