# Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft's implementation and extension of the Common Information Model (CIM), forming a key part of the standardized Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) for the Windows platform. WMI allows for comprehensive read and write access to almost all settings on Windows systems. This capability makes it an essential interface for the administration and remote maintenance of Windows computers, whether they are PCs or servers. WMI can be accessed through PowerShell, VBScript, or the Windows Management Instrumentation Console (WMIC). Rather than being a single program, WMI consists of multiple programs and various databases, known as repositories.
