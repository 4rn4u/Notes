# Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial component of the Internet, translating domain names like academy.hackthebox.com or www.hackthebox.com into IP addresses. This system, which lacks a central database, functions like a library with numerous phone books, distributing information across thousands of name servers. Globally distributed DNS servers map domain names to IP addresses, determining which server a user can reach via a particular domain. There are several types of DNS servers used worldwide:

## Types of DNS Servers

### DNS Root Server
DNS root servers handle the top-level domains (TLDs) and act as a central interface between users and content on the Internet. They are requested only if other name servers do not respond. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinates the work of the 13 root servers globally.
### Authoritative Name Server
Authoritative name servers have authority over specific zones and provide binding responses to queries within their responsibility. If they cannot answer a query, the root name server takes over.
### Non-authoritative Name Server
Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for any particular DNS zone. Instead, they gather information on specific DNS zones through recursive or iterative DNS queries.
### Caching DNS Server
Caching DNS servers store information from other name servers for a specified period, determined by the authoritative name server.
### Forwarding Server
Forwarding servers solely forward DNS queries to another DNS server.
### Resolver
Resolvers are local components in a computer or router that perform name resolution but are not authoritative DNS servers.

DNS is typically unencrypted, allowing devices on local networks and Internet providers to intercept and spy on DNS queries, posing a privacy risk. To address this, solutions for DNS encryption have been developed. IT security professionals commonly use DNS over TLS (DoT) or DNS over HTTPS (DoH). Additionally, the DNSCrypt protocol encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server. Beyond mapping computer names to IP addresses, DNS also stores and provides additional information about services associated with a domain. For example, a DNS query can reveal which computer serves as the domain's email server or the names of the domain's name servers.
