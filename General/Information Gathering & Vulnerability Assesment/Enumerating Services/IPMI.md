# Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)

Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring. It functions as an autonomous subsystem, independent of the host's BIOS, CPU, firmware, and operating system. IPMI allows sysadmins to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or unresponsive. It operates via a direct network connection to the system's hardware, bypassing the need for OS-level access.

## Key Uses of IPMI

IPMI is typically used in three main scenarios:
1. **Pre-OS Boot**: Modify BIOS settings before the operating system has booted.
2. **Powered Down Host**: Manage the system when it is fully powered down.
3. **Post-System Failure**: Access a host after a system failure.

Additionally, IPMI can monitor various system metrics, such as temperature, voltage, fan status, and power supplies. It can also query inventory information, review hardware logs, and send alerts via SNMP. While the host system can be powered off, the IPMI module requires a power source and a LAN connection.

## History and Support

First published by Intel in 1998, IPMI is now supported by over 200 system vendors, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Supermicro, Intel, and more. Systems using IPMI version 2.0 can be administered via serial over LAN, allowing sysadmins to view serial console output in-band.

## Components of IPMI

To function effectively, IPMI relies on several key components:

- **Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)**: A micro-controller that is essential to IPMI.
- **Intelligent Chassis Management Bus (ICMB)**: An interface that allows communication between chassis.
- **Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB)**: Extends the capabilities of the BMC.
- **IPMI Memory**: Stores system event logs, repository data, and more.
- **Communication Interfaces**: Includes local system interfaces, serial and LAN interfaces, ICMB, and PCI Management Bus.

IPMI provides a robust and versatile system management solution, ensuring sysadmins have control over their systems regardless of the system's power state or operational status.
