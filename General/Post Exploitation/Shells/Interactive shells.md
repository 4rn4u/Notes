## Execution Permissions Considerations

In addition to knowing about all the options listed above, we should be mindful of the permissions we have with the shell session's account. We can always attempt to run this command to list the file properties and permissions our account has over any given file or binary:
```shell-session
ls -la <path/to/fileorbinary>
```

#### Sudo -l
```shell-session
sudo -l
```
