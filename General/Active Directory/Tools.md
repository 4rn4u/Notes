| **PowerView/SharpView**    | PowerShell and .NET tools for situational awareness in AD. Replacing Windows `net*` commands, these tools gather AD data (like BloodHound), but require more effort to connect data points. Useful for discovering additional access privileges, identifying target users or systems, and finding vulnerable accounts for Kerberoasting or ASREPRoasting attacks.                                             |
| **BloodHound**      | A tool for visual mapping of AD relationships to reveal possible attack paths. It uses the SharpHound PowerShell or C# ingestor to gather data, then imports this data into the BloodHound Electron app with a Neo4j database for visualizing AD paths.                                                                                                                      |
| **SharpHound**      | Collects AD information on users, groups, computers, ACLs, GPOs, and more in JSON format. This data can then be analyzed with BloodHound for attack path mapping.                                                                                                                                                                        |
