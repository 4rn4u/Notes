Webs where we can find some information:


For example in [_GitHub_](https://github.com/) we can use the search engine to find for a company or users and see the repos or public available code:
```
owner:companyname path:whatwewanttosearch
```

- [_GitHub Gist_](https://gist.github.com/)
- [_GitLab_](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [_SourceForge_](https://sourceforge.net/)


Also we have determined tools that helps us finding some results into really big repos. They are called:
- [_Gitrob_](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob)Â 
- [_Gitleaks_](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)
