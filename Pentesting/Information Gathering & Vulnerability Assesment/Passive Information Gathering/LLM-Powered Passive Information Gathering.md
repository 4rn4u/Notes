Passive reconnaissance becomes easier with the usage of tools like LLM. With this we can perform passive analysis in a easier manner. We can use prompts in order to obtain public information from a business or to get some examples of possible steps to do. Here we have some examples:

```
- Can you print all the public information about a company structure and employees from x?
- Can you provide the best x google dorks for x website tailored for a penetration test?
- Retrieve the technology stack of x website
- What is the WHOIS information for the domain x
- What public information is available about the leadership of x and their social media presence?
- Can you provide the top Google dorks to search for exposed repositories related to x?
- Can you provide advanced passive enumeration techniques for identifying potential subdomains on x?
- Can you provide advanced passive enumeration techniques for identifying potential subdomains on x?
```
