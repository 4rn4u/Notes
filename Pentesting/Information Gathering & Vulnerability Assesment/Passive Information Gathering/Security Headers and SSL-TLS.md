This is not completely into Passive information Gathering as the recon is taking some interaction with the target but it is so useful. In this case we have [_Security Headers_](https://securityheaders.com/) which will provide us with some information regarding the security headers of the web. This is accomplished by making an HTTP request to the desired web server and providing basic analysis of the target's security posture.

The site is missing several defensive headers, such as [_Content-Security-Policy_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and [_X-Frame-Options_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options). These missing headers are not necessarily vulnerabilities in and of themselves, but they could indicate web developers or server admins that are not familiar with [_server hardening_](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-123/final)
Other good tool/page is [_Qualys SSL Labs_](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) which analyses a server's SSL/TLS configuration and compares it against current best practices.
