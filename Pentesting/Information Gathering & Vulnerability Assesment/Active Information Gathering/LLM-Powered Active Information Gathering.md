## 🧭 Overview

Language models (LLMs) can enhance active enumeration, especially during DNS recon. By automating tasks like wordlist generation and pattern analysis, they improve both speed and effectiveness in discovering subdomains and infrastructure.

## 🌐 DNS Enumeration with LLMs

DNS enumeration reveals:

- Subdomains
- Mail/name servers
- Misconfigurations
- Hidden assets

LLMs assist by:

- Analyzing DNS results
- Recognizing naming conventions
- Building tailored wordlists
- Correlating WHOIS, reverse DNS, and other open data

⚠️ **Important:** Always validate LLM output manually and follow legal/ethical guidelines when performing active reconnaissance.

## 📜 Generating DNS Wordlists with LLMs

Traditionally, wordlist creation was manual and slow. Now, LLMs can automate this using a prompt based on the target’s:

- Public website structure
- Services/products
- Departments/regions
- Common naming conventions

### 🧠 Example LLM Prompt

```text
Using public data from targetdomain.com and any inferred structure, generate a list of potential subdomains.

Include common patterns such as:
- Infrastructure terms: api, dev, staging
- Services: mail, auth, cdn
- Departments: hr, sales, support
- Regions: us, eu, asia
Output a list of 1000 unique, lowercase subdomain terms. No duplicates, no bullet points, plain text only.
````

💡 _Make sure to ask for output that’s clean and directly usable in a brute-force tool._

## 🔨 DNS Brute Forcing with Gobuster

### 📦 Install Gobuster

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gobuster
```

### 🚀 Run Enumeration

```bash
gobuster dns -d targetdomain.com -w wordlist.txt -t 10
```

**Parameters:**

- `-d`: Domain to target
    
- `-w`: Wordlist file (from LLM)
    
- `-t`: Threads (e.g., 10 for faster scan)
    

### 🧪 Sample Output

```
Found: admin.targetdomain.com
Found: router.targetdomain.com
Found: mail.targetdomain.com
Found: support.targetdomain.com
Found: test.targetdomain.com
```

## 💡 Why Use LLMs Here?

- Generates wordlists tailored to **actual naming logic** of a target
    
- Saves time over manual creation
    
- Often reveals more **valid and relevant** subdomains
    
- Easily repeatable with new prompts or tweaks
    

> 🔁 If the LLM doesn’t return enough results, modify and resend the prompt for better output.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- `gobuster`: DNS brute-forcing
    
- `ChatGPT` (or other LLM): Wordlist generation
    
- `bash`: CLI environment for recon tasks

## ✅ Summary

Using LLMs in active recon lets you:

- Automate repetitive tasks
    
- Focus on high-value analysis
    
- Speed up DNS subdomain discovery
    
- Build smarter, more focused wordlists
    

Combining tools like `gobuster` with LLM-generated input can significantly increase recon accuracy and efficiency.
