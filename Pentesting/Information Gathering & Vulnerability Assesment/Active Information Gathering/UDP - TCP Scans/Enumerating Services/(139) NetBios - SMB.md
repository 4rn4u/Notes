NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a legacy networking protocol used for communication between computers on a local network. It provides **name resolution, session services, and datagram distribution** to allow devices to identify and communicate with each other without requiring a DNS server.

### **What NetBIOS is Used For:**

1. **Name Resolution** – Converts NetBIOS names to IP addresses (via NBNS, similar to DNS).
2. **File and Printer Sharing** – Facilitates communication over **SMB (Server Message Block)** for accessing shared files, folders, and printers.
3. **Session Management** – Establishes and maintains direct communication sessions between networked devices.
4. **Legacy Application Support** – Some older Windows applications still rely on NetBIOS for network functionality.

### **Why It's Important to Scan NetBIOS During SMB Pentesting:**

- **Identifies Hostnames & Shares** – Attackers can gather valuable details about connected devices, shares, and user accounts.
- **Exposes Misconfigurations** – Open NetBIOS services can lead to **unauthorized access or credential leaks**.
- **Vulnerable to Spoofing & Poisoning** – Attackers can perform **LLMNR/NBNS poisoning** to capture NTLM hashes for credential attacks.
- **Helps in SMB Exploitation** – Weak NetBIOS settings can be exploited to compromise SMB services (e.g., EternalBlue, SMB relay attacks).


```bash
$ nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 192.168.50.1-254
```

#### nbtscan
We can use this to query the NetBIOS name service for valid NetBIOS names, specifying the originating UDP port as 137 with the `-r` option.
```bash
$ sudo nbtscan -r 192.168.50.0/24
```
