## Windows
#### LSASS

[Local Security Authority Subsystem Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service) (`LSASS`) is a collection of many modules and has access to all authentication processes that can be found in `%SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe`. This service is responsible for the local system security policy, user authentication, and sending security audit logs to the `Event log`. In other words, it is the vault for Windows-based operating systems, and we can find a more detailed illustration of the LSASS architecture [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc961760(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Lsasrv.dll`                | The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. The LSA contains the Negotiate function, which selects either the NTLM or Kerberos protocol after determining which protocol is to be successful. |
| `Msv1_0.dll`                | Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Samsrv.dll`                | The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.                                                                                                                                       |
| `Kerberos.dll`              | Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Netlogon.dll`              | Network-based logon service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Ntdsa.dll`                 | This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.                                                                                                                                                                                |
Each interactive logon session creates a separate instance of the Winlogon service. The [Graphical Identification and Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/gina) (`GINA`) architecture is loaded into the process area used by Winlogon, receives and processes the credentials, and invokes the authentication interfaces via the [LSALogonUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalogonuser) function.

#### SAM Database

The [Security Account Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc756748(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (`SAM`) is a database file in Windows operating systems that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the system. User passwords are stored in a hash format in a registry structure as either an `LM` hash or an `NTLM` hash. This file is located in `%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM` and is mounted on HKLM/SAM. SYSTEM level permissions are required to view it.

Windows systems can be assigned to either a workgroup or domain during setup. If the system has been assigned to a workgroup, it handles the SAM database locally and stores all existing users locally in this database. However, if the system has been joined to a domain, the Domain Controller (`DC`) must validate the credentials from the Active Directory database (`ntds.dit`), which is stored in `%SystemRoot%\ntds.dit`.

Microsoft introduced a security feature in Windows NT 4.0 to help improve the security of the SAM database against offline software cracking. This is the `SYSKEY` (`syskey.exe`) feature, which, when enabled, partially encrypts the hard disk copy of the SAM file so that the password hash values for all local accounts stored in the SAM are encrypted with a key.
