### What is a Buffer Overflow?

A **buffer overflow** is a type of vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data into a fixed-size buffer (a block of memory) than it was intended to hold. This extra data can **spill over** into adjacent memory, potentially leading to **unintended behavior**, **crashes**, or even **remote code execution** by an attacker.

### How It Happens

Buffers are often used to store user input. If the program does not properly validate the size of the input, an attacker can input more data than the buffer can handle. This can:

- Overwrite **control data** such as return addresses or function pointers
- Modify variables or memory structures
- Redirect the program's execution flow to **malicious code**

### Example

If a buffer is allocated to hold 16 bytes:
```c
char buffer[16];
gets(buffer);  // unsafe function, does not check input size
````

If the user inputs 32 bytes, the extra 16 bytes will overwrite whatever memory comes after `buffer`, which could include **the return address of the function**.

### Why It Matters

Buffer overflows have been the root cause of many high-profile vulnerabilities. They are commonly found in **low-level languages** like C and C++ that don't have built-in bounds checking.

Even though modern systems use protections like **ASLR**, **DEP**, and **stack canaries**, understanding buffer overflows is still essential for **exploit development** and **vulnerability assessment**.
