## URL Encoding

It is essential to ensure that our request data is URL-encoded and our request headers are correctly set. Otherwise, we may get a server error in the response. This is why encoding and decoding data becomes essential as we modify and repeat web requests. Some of the key characters we need to encode are:

- `Spaces`: May indicate the end of request data if not encoded
- `&`: Otherwise interpreted as a parameter delimiter
- `#`: Otherwise interpreted as a fragment identifier
## Decoding

While URL-encoding is key to HTTP requests, it is not the only type of encoding we will encounter. It is very common for web applications to encode their data, so we should be able to quickly decode that data to examine the original text. On the other hand, back-end servers may expect data to be encoded in a particular format or with a specific encoder, so we need to be able to quickly encode our data before we send it.

The following are some of the other types of encoders supported by both tools:

- HTML
- Unicode
- Base64
- ASCII hex

To access the full encoder in Burp, we can go to the `Decoder` tab. In ZAP, we can use the `Encoder/Decoder/Hash` by clicking [`CTRL+E`]. With these encoders, we can input any text and have it quickly encoded or decoded. For example, perhaps we came across the following cookie that is base64 encoded, and we need to decode it: `eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwgImlzX2FkbWluIjpmYWxzZX0=`
