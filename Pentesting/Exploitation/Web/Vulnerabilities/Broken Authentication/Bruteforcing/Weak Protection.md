### Weak Brute-Force Protection

Brute-force attacks exploit vulnerabilities in authentication systems by repeatedly trying different credentials until a match is found. To counter these attacks, common security mechanisms like **rate limiting** and **CAPTCHAs** are implemented to make brute-forcing more challenging.

#### Rate Limiting

**Rate limiting** is a technique that controls the number of requests a system or API can receive within a certain timeframe. By limiting requests, rate limiting protects servers from overload and reduces the feasibility of brute-force attacks. When a rate limit is reached, the system may incrementally delay responses or block the user temporarily, which can make brute-forcing impractical.

- **Implementation Challenges**: Rate limits are typically enforced based on the requester's IP address. However, in complex environments with reverse proxies, load balancers, or caches, the system may only see the IP of the intermediary device. To address this, some rate-limiting implementations rely on headers like **X-Forwarded-For** to capture the true IP. However, attackers can manipulate these headers to bypass rate limits by randomizing the IP in each request. This vulnerability was noted in CVE-2020-35590, where attackers used header manipulation to evade rate limits.

#### CAPTCHAs

**CAPTCHAs** are a security measure that distinguishes between human users and bots by requiring users to solve challenges that are easy for humans but hard for automated scripts. Common CAPTCHA types include identifying distorted text, selecting specific images, or solving puzzles. By enforcing CAPTCHA challenges, websites prevent bots from performing repeated actions like brute-forcing login credentials.

- **Usability Concerns**: While CAPTCHAs are effective against bots, they can present accessibility issues for users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities. Poorly implemented CAPTCHAs may also inadvertently reveal their answers in the response, enabling attackers to bypass them.

- **Automated CAPTCHA Solving**: With the rise of AI and machine learning, tools now exist to automate CAPTCHA solving. Open-source solutions and advanced image recognition models allow attackers to potentially bypass CAPTCHA defenses.

In summary, effective brute-force protection combines rate limiting, well-implemented CAPTCHAs, and proper handling of headers and IP addresses to minimize bypass risks while considering user accessibility.
