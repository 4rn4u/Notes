Before we learn how to discover XSS vulnerabilities and utilize them for various attacks, we must first understand the different types of XSS vulnerabilities and their differences to know which to use in each kind of attack.

The first and most critical type of XSS vulnerability is `Stored XSS` or `Persistent XSS`. If our injected XSS payload gets stored in the back-end database and retrieved upon visiting the page, this means that our XSS attack is persistent and may affect any user that visits the page.

This makes this type of XSS the most critical, as it affects a much wider audience since any user who visits the page would be a victim of this attack. Furthermore, Stored XSS may not be easily removable, and the payload may need removing from the back-end database.

## XSS Testing Payloads
```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```
**Tip:** Many modern web applications utilize cross-domain IFrames to handle user input, so that even if the web form is vulnerable to XSS, it would not be a vulnerability on the main web application. This is why we are showing the value of `window.origin` in the alert box, instead of a static value like `1`. In this case, the alert box would reveal the URL it is being executed on, and will confirm which form is the vulnerable one, in case an IFrame was being used.
