There are two types of `Non-Persistent XSS` vulnerabilities: `Reflected XSS`, which gets processed by the back-end server, and `DOM-based XSS`, which is completely processed on the client-side and never reaches the back-end server. Unlike Persistent XSS, `Non-Persistent XSS` vulnerabilities are temporary and are not persistent through page refreshes. Hence, our attacks only affect the targeted user and will not affect other users who visit the page.

`Reflected XSS` vulnerabilities occur when our input reaches the back-end server and gets returned to us without being filtered or sanitized. There are many cases in which our entire input might get returned to us, like error messages or confirmation messages. In these cases, we may attempt using XSS payloads to see whether they execute. However, as these are usually temporary messages, once we move from the page, they would not execute again, and hence they are `Non-Persistent`.
