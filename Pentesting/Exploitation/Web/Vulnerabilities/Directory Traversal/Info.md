## 🛣️ Absolute vs Relative Paths

### 🔍 Absolute Paths
Absolute paths start from the root directory `/` and specify the full path to a file. They can be used from any location in the file system. For example, `/etc/passwd` can be accessed directly from any directory by referencing its full path.

Example steps:
- Use `pwd` to confirm current directory (e.g., `/home/kali`)
- Use `ls /` to list root contents and confirm `etc` exists
- Use `cat /etc/passwd` to display the file content

### 🧭 Relative Paths
Relative paths are based on the current working directory. You can navigate up one level using `../`. Multiple levels up can be achieved by chaining these sequences, such as `../../`.

Example steps:
- From `/home/kali`, using `ls ../` shows contents of `/home`
- Using `ls ../../` shows the root directory
- Accessing the file with `cat ../../etc/passwd` reads the same file as with the absolute path

You can also use many `../` sequences to ensure reaching the root, which is helpful if the exact working directory is unknown. For instance, `../../../../../../etc/passwd` will still resolve correctly if enough `../` are used to back out to root.

> The number of `../` segments beyond the root directory has no effect. Once `/` is reached, traversal stops.
