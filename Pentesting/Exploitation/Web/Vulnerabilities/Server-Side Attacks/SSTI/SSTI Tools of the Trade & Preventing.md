### Preventing Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

To effectively prevent SSTI vulnerabilities, itâ€™s essential to ensure that **user input is never inserted directly into the template code** passed to the rendering function. By strictly controlling how templates and user data are handled, we can avoid the risk of executing injected malicious code.

#### Key Prevention Strategies

1. **Isolate User Input**: Ensure user input is always provided as separate data, not as part of the template itself. Reviewing and securing code paths that handle templates can help prevent accidental injection of user data into templates before rendering.

2. **Controlled Template Modifications**: If the application requires users to edit or upload templates, enforce security hardening measures:
   - **Limit Functionality**: Remove dangerous functions and capabilities within the template engine that could enable remote code execution. This makes it harder for attackers to execute malicious code within templates.
   - **Isolated Execution Environment**: Run the template engine in a separate environment from the main web server. Using isolated environments like Docker containers provides additional security by containing potential exploits, preventing them from affecting the entire server.

These strategies help ensure that user input remains separate from template code, reducing the risk of SSTI by containing template rendering to a secure, controlled environment.
