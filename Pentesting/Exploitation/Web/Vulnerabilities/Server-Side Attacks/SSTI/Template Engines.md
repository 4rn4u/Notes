### Overview of Template Engines

A **template engine** is a tool that combines static templates with dynamic data to produce content, widely used in web development for generating pages with shared structures like headers and footers. This approach allows developers to maintain consistency across pages without duplicating code, streamlining updates and reducing complexity. Well-known template engines include **Jinja** (Python) and **Twig** (PHP).

### How Templating Works

Template engines require two main inputs: 

1. **A Template**: Defines the layout with placeholders for dynamic data. This can be a string or a file, outlining where the dynamic values should be inserted.
2. **Dynamic Data**: Supplied as key-value pairs, where each key corresponds to a placeholder in the template. During rendering, the engine replaces each placeholder with its matching value.

This process, known as **rendering**, generates the final content by combining the template with dynamic data. The syntax varies between engines; for instance, Jinja uses double curly braces `{{ }}` for variables.

### Example of Templating in Jinja

Consider a simple Jinja template:

```jinja2
Hello {{ name }}!
```

The template contains a placeholder `{{ name }}`. If we supply `name="vautia"` to the rendering function, it produces:

```
Hello vautia!
```

### Advanced Templating Features

Modern template engines often include programming-like features, such as **loops** and **conditional statements**. For instance, with Jinja, a template can loop over a list of names:

```jinja2
{% for name in names %}
Hello {{ name }}!
{% endfor %}
```

When we supply `names=["vautia", "21y4d", "Pedant"]`, the engine outputs:

```
Hello vautia!
Hello 21y4d!
Hello Pedant!
```

This flexibility allows template engines to efficiently handle dynamic, data-driven content in a consistent format across pages.
