### Introduction to Server-Side Include (SSI) Injection

**Server-Side Includes (SSI)** is a technology used by web servers like Apache and IIS to add dynamic content within static HTML pages. SSI directives allow web pages to execute commands or display dynamic data, which can make them more interactive. Files that use SSI often have extensions like `.shtml`, `.shtm`, and `.stm`, but the server configuration can allow SSI in other file types as well, so the file extension alone is not a definitive indicator of SSI use.

### Common SSI Directives

SSI commands, or **directives**, are special commands within HTML comments that instruct the server to execute certain actions when serving a page. Typical directives include:

- **`printenv`**: Displays environment variables. Example:
    ```html
    <!--#printenv -->
    ```

- **`config`**: Adjusts SSI settings. For instance, changing the error message:
    ```html
    <!--#config errmsg="Error!" -->
    ```

- **`echo`**: Prints values of variables like the current file’s name or last modification time. Example:
    ```html
    <!--#echo var="DOCUMENT_NAME" var="DATE_LOCAL" -->
    ```

- **`exec`**: Executes a command, such as displaying the current user with:
    ```html
    <!--#exec cmd="whoami" -->
    ```

- **`include`**: Inserts the contents of a specified file (within the web root) into the page:
    ```html
    <!--#include virtual="index.html" -->
    ```

### What is SSI Injection?

**SSI Injection** occurs when an attacker is able to inject SSI directives into a file that will be rendered by the web server. When the server processes this file, it may execute the attacker’s injected SSI commands, leading to potentially harmful outcomes like command execution or data exposure.

#### Common Scenarios for SSI Injection

1. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**: If an application has insecure file upload functionality, an attacker might upload a file with malicious SSI directives to the server's web root, causing those commands to execute.

2. **User Input in Files**: If an application writes unvalidated user input to files in the web root, attackers could inject SSI directives, which the server may then execute.

In summary, preventing SSI injection requires careful validation of files uploaded to web-accessible directories and stringent input validation before writing data to files that could be interpreted by the server.
