### Blind SSRF Overview

In **blind SSRF** vulnerabilities, attackers cannot see the server’s response directly, which limits exploitation options. Since attackers cannot inspect responses, the potential impact of blind SSRF is typically lower than non-blind SSRF.

### Identifying Blind SSRF

To identify blind SSRF, attackers often direct the server to a controlled URL and monitor connections, using tools like `netcat` to detect activity on specific ports. This method confirms whether the server is making requests, even without direct response visibility.

### Exploiting Blind SSRF

Blind SSRF exploitation is limited but still possible. Here are some techniques:

- **Port Scanning**: By observing different responses for open and closed ports, attackers can conduct restricted port scans. A response indicating "Something went wrong" signals a closed port, while a different error may indicate an open port.
- **File Existence Checking**: While reading files isn’t possible, attackers can check if specific files exist based on differing error messages for valid versus invalid file paths.

Overall, while blind SSRF restricts visibility and thus the impact, it still allows some limited network and file reconnaissance.
