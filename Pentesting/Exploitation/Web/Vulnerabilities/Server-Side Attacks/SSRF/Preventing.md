### Mitigating SSRF Vulnerabilities

After understanding how to identify and exploit SSRF vulnerabilities, let's focus on effective prevention strategies.

#### Key Prevention Techniques

**Application-Level Mitigations**: 
To protect a web application from SSRF attacks, implementing both input validation and strict controls on allowed request targets is essential. Specifically:

- **Whitelist Approved URLs**: Only allow connections to a set of trusted destinations. This prevents attackers from directing the server to unintended or malicious targets, particularly internal network locations.
- **Restrict URL Schemes**: Limit the allowed protocols (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) to prevent attackers from supplying alternative schemes like `file://` or `gopher://`. The application should either enforce a specific protocol or verify against an allowed list.
- **Sanitize User Input**: Apply input validation and sanitization to ensure no malicious or unexpected URLs can slip through, reducing the risk of exploitation through malformed or deceptive input.

**Network-Level Defenses**: 
Network security settings provide another layer of protection:

- **Firewall Rules**: Set up firewalls to block unauthorized outbound requests, preventing the application from reaching unexpected or sensitive network locations. If firewall rules are configured correctly, they can effectively stop SSRF attempts at the network boundary.
- **Network Segmentation**: Limit the web serverâ€™s access to sensitive internal systems. By segmenting the network, attackers are restricted from reaching sensitive areas even if an SSRF vulnerability is exploited.
