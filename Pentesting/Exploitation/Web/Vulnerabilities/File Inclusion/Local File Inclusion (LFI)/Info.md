**LFI (Local File Inclusion)** is a **web vulnerability** that allows an attacker to include files from the server's **local filesystem** in a web application's output.

### üîç How it works:

If a web app lets users specify a file name in the URL or a parameter and doesn't properly validate it, an attacker can exploit it like this:

```
http://example.com/page.php?file=about.php
```

If the app uses something like:

```php
include($_GET['file']);
```

An attacker could do:

```
http://example.com/page.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
```

And the app might show contents of `/etc/passwd`.

### üî• What can attackers do?

- Read sensitive files (`/etc/passwd`, config files, credentials).
- Combine with **file upload** vulnerabilities to achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è How to prevent it:

- **Whitelist** allowed files.
- Avoid direct `include()`/`require()` with user input.
- Use **static paths** or **ID references**, not filenames.
- Enable **safe server configurations** (e.g., disable dangerous functions in PHP).

Consider an LFI vulnerability in a JSP-based web application. If we're able to inject JSP code into a file via **log poisoning**, and then include that file through the LFI vulnerability, the code will execute. The main difference from the earlier PHP example is that the injected payload would be written in JSP instead of PHP.
