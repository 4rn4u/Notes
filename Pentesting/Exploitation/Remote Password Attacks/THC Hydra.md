# POST Login Forms
We have to first check which will be the delimiters in order to know if the login has been completed succesfully. We first catch the request by burp and we determine the response codes. Now as we have determined that the server responses says "Login failed." when the login is not fulfilled we have this command as an example:

```
hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 1.1.1.1 http-post-form "/index.php:fm_usr=user&fm_pwd=^PASS^:Login failed. Invalid"
```
