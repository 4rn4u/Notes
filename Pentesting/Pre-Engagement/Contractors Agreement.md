# Contractors Agreement

If the penetration test also includes physical testing, then an additional contractor's agreement is required. Since it is not only a virtual environment but also a physical intrusion, completely different laws apply here. It is also possible that many of the employees have not been informed about the test. Suppose we encounter employees with a very high-security awareness during the physical attack and social engineering attempts, and we get caught. In that case, the employees will, in most cases, contact the police. This additional contractor's agreement is our "get out of jail free card" in this case.
