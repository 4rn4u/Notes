- **Scope**: The primary target for this penetration test was the web application at [https://kali.org/login.php](https://kali.org/login.php).  
- **Timeframe**: Testing occurred from **January 3 to January 5, 2022**.  
- **Methodology**: The assessment followed **OWASP** and **PCI** standards.  
- **Exclusions**: Social engineering and denial-of-service (DoS) testing were out of scope.  
- **Black-Box Approach**: No dedicated test user accounts were provided; testing was conducted externally.  
- **Testing IP**: Activities originated from **192.168.1.2**.

In **October 2025**, the client engaged an independent security consultancy to evaluate the `kali.org` web application. The test was conducted remotely during business hours (9 AM to 5 PM), and no user credentials were supplied.

## Security Posture Observations

1. **Hardening Measures**  
   - The testing team was **unable to upload malicious files**, indicating strong file-filtering controls.  
   - A **robust lockout policy** prevented brute-force attempts on user accounts.  
   - A **strict password policy** makes trivial password guesses less likely to succeed.  
   Overall, these defenses suggest a focus on user account security.

2. **Areas of Concern**  
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vector**: The testers found a way to inject arbitrary JavaScript that would execute within a victimâ€™s browser.  
   - **Username Enumeration**: Error messages on the login form exposed the validity of usernames, potentially aiding targeted attacks.  
   - **Unsanitized Input & Verbose Errors**: Insufficient input sanitization and overly detailed error messages raise the risk of credential or session theft. To mitigate this, **sanitize all user inputs** and use **generic error messaging** to prevent exploitation.

## Patch Management

Windows and Ubuntu operating systems that are not up to date were
identified. These are shown to be vulnerable to publicly-available
exploits and could result in malicious execution of code, theft
of sensitive information, or cause denial of services which may
impact the infrastructure. Using outdated applications increases the
possibility of an intruder gaining unauthorized access by exploiting
known vulnerabilities. Patch management ought to be improved and
updates should be applied in conjunction with change management.
